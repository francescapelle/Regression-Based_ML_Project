# Regression-Based_ML_Project
This was my first ML project where I predicted revenue for the following year.

This project was part of my Machine Learning class taught by Chase Kusterer at Hult International Business School. The professor created a business case of a meal-kit delivery company (explained in detail in the file Course Case - Apprentice Chef, Inc..pdf) and in this first task we were assigned with predicting revenue over the first year of each customerâ€™s life cycle.
